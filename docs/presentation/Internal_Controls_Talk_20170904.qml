        However they failed one by one. It seems impossible to gain a share of the market ruled by Android and IOS.
        But as a technology, QtQuick survived. It is still a choice for cross platform mobile development.
        It gets expanded into embedded system as well.

        I cannot say much about desktop applications. But KDE shell has migrated to QtQuick.

        I am not a GTK user so this example is taken from its tutorial.
        Even not an expert, we can see it first creates a window, 
        and exit when this window gets closed. The text label is then created inside
        the window. The last step is to show the window and enter into the
        event loop.
        That is quite a standard launching sequence for a GUI program.

        notes: '
        The quick version is remarkably different. The import statement looks like many other languages.
        It brings components from other modules into the namespace.
        
        The creation of the a text lable is nothing like previouse examples. Syntatically it is a structural text,
        like a literal object in JavaScript. This object has a named type, and properties to describe it.

        The text property holds the greeting string to display. We can control its appearance via other properties assignment.

        In Qt 5.10 Vulkan will be added, the successor to OpenGL.

        A state is set of property settings. The intial default state is defined by the assigned property values.
        New states can be created by grouping different property changes.
        Here we change the text color and font size.

        To smooth the property changes between states, animations might be configured.
        Here the font size changes in half a second and color changes in 1 second.

        Together this creates a fluid user experience.

        Most toolkits use Model/View design pattern to separate data and its representation.
        Qt uses the  term Model/View/Delegate.
        
        Model contains the data. In this case it is a list of fruits. Each fruit gets properties
        like name and color.
        View organises the data display. Here it is shown in a column.
        Delegate decides how the data appears in the view. Here it simply displays the fruit name.

        But we can give it some color too.
