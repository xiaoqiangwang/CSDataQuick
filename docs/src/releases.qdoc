    \section2 core libs
    \list
    \li Add a new type of data engine \l {QCSDataEngineLocal} {\e local}. The source scheme is loc://<source>[.{json object}]

    \li Refactor utils.cpp to a shared library.
    \endlist

    \section2 quick components
    \list
    \li Re-implement UtilsJS.formatString and DynamicAttribute in C++.
    \li dynamicAttribute and limits properties can be used in quick designer. The previouse workaround
        is removed, which means the previous designer generated files should be updated, by replacing
        "dynamicAttribute_" with "dynamicAttribute.", "limits_" with "limits.".
    \li Add custom property editor for CSMJPEGVideo in quick designer.
    \li Add font and fontSizeMode properties to CSText and CSTextUpdate for custom font selection.

    \li Fix handling of empty CSData::source to disconnect and reset the data.
